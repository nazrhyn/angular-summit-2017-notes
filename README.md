    _The State of Angular in 2017_   
    The entire landscape of AngularJS has been changing rapidly. What does it all mean?
    
    It seems as though Angular2 was just released, and Angular 4 is already being finalized. Angular uses semver, which means 4 contains breaking changes again. What does this mean for our Angular2 (and Angular1) projects, and what happened to Angular3? Find out in this keynote - The State of Angular in 2017

    The Flexbox Layout is an indispensable tool for defining UI layouts and easy solving some common issues like vertical centering, same-height columns, reordering and changing direction. It supported by all the main browsers and platforms and works for the responsive web design perfectly. How to use the power of this CSS box model in Angular developer-friendly way using APIs?
    
    Meet Flex Layout from Angular Material team - the smartest way to automate the process of applying appropriate Flexbox CSS to browser view hierarchies. No more complexities and workarounds of traditional, CSS way, but the real power to easily and intuitively specify different layouts, sizing, visibilities for different viewport sizes and display devices.
    
    Letâ€™s discover Angular Flex Layout advantages by real-life examples and check how easy to add the responsiveness to any SPA using the Responsive API features.
1. **[Angular Mobile Toolkit](https://github.com/nazrhyn/angular-summit-2017-notes/blob/master/angular-mobile-toolkit/angular-mobile-toolkit.md)** - Christina Kayastha ([@christikaes](https://twitter.com/christikaes) | [/christinakayastha](https://github.com/christinakayastha))   
    _Progressive Web Apps_   
    **Slides:** [local](https://github.com/nazrhyn/angular-summit-2017-notes/blob/master/angular-mobile.toolkit/angular-mobile.toolkit.pdf)   
    One of the things that makes Angular so powerful is all of the tooling that it comes with. One piece of tooling is the Angular Mobile Toolkit and how it helps you easily setup Progressive Web Apps. PWAs will help you create an offline first experience, so that even users with little or no connectivity can experience your web app.
    
    In this talk we will talk about the basics of what makes a PWA, and go through the steps of implementing a service worker. We will tie it all together with the Angular Mobile Toolkit.
